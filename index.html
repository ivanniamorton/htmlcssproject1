      <h1>Death Of Devacurl</h1>
      <h2>By Ivannia Morton</h2>
      <p>
        DevaCurl has been synonymous with curly hair for years. DevaCurl originated from the first DevaChan salon opened in New York City in 1994. Nearly 30 years later, the brand has transformed the lives of curly and kinky heads around the world.
        Not only had the brand become a pioneer in the beauty industry, but the overarching natural-hair movement. Since February 2020, multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed against the brand alleging hair-loss and complete chemical damage
        as a result of using the products. Popular beauty YouTube creator Ayesha Malik had posted a video of the damage her famous curls sustained, and since then the lawsuit has snowballed. Whether you’re considering DevaCurl products for you or a
        loved one, this guide goes over the chemicals at the center of the lawsuit and what to look out for. </p>

            Propylene Glycol is used to preserve moisture in Devacurl products. At certain amounts, Propylene Glycol can cause seizures, and it is widely used to make anti-freeze. Cocamidopropyl Betaine is used as a surfactant in DevaCurl products.
            It is a known carcinogen and irritates both mucus membranes and skin. Phenoxyethanol is also a carcinogen and linked to causing reactions like eczema. Laureth-4 is another surfactant commonly used in cuticle softeners and deodorants and
            can cause acne. Ceteareth-20 works to speed the passage of chemicals directly into your bloodstream and is suggested to avoid putting on irritated skin. Diazolidinyl Urea acts as formaldehyde in DevaCurl products. The very same
            formaldehyde that when in contact with heat acts as a chemical relaxer on hair. </p>

            A great step to combat the use of these tricky ingredients is to download the ThinkDirty App. The app allows you to scan the barcode of your beauty products and breaks down the ingredients that make the product ‘dirty.’ Shopping for curly
            hair products is already very expensive, but affordable alternatives do exist. If you’re on a budget, try Shea Moisture. While not all of their products clean, their coconut/hibiscus line scores very well on the ThinkDirty app. If you are
            looking for something on the pricier side, check out Briogeo. Briogeo is 93-100% naturally derived and is vegan as well. They provide a comprehensive ingredient glossary on their website that breaks down what you’re consuming. </p>
